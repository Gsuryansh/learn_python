List are mutable tupple are immutable.

Mutable: It means that the value of an object can be changed after its creation.

Immutable: Value of an object can not be changed after it creation.

Benifit of using immutable is that it requires less memory.because python allocate an overhead memory while creating immutable object
to modify later.
