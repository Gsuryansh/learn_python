class shroom(object):
    def move(self):
        print("Big mario is moving")
class mario(object):
    def move(self):
        print("I am moving")

class BigMarion(mario,shroom):
    def __init__(self):
        print("yegyu")

Bm=BigMarion()
Bm.move()


so here we have two classes shroom and marion and third class Bigmarion inheriting both the parent class.And both mario and shroom 
have same method move().When we creat an object of child class and call the method move().First it will check the method in the child
class itself if it does not find the method it will goto to the child class defination and search from right to left
Method Resolution Order (MRO)

In our case it will call the method of mario because it is the left most in the child class definetion.
