Self is the object itself.

Example:  


class abc():
 
    def __init__(self):
	   print("Something")
	   
	def xyz(self):
        print("Inside xyz")


obj=abc()

obj.xyz() # ptyhon convert this statment as abc.xyz(obj) that means self reciving the object itself

Python "self" is same like "this" in c++ and java.	

Instance variable are the variable whose value assigned inside the init function or by self inside the function
