If we run the python file directly then it name the __name__ variable as __main__.



Example: 

    Suppose we have python file as abc.py
	
	#abc file coding.
	
	
	print(__name__)# it will print __main__
	
	
	Suppose we have another file called xyz.py and we will import abc.py file in xyz then the variable __name__ in abc will be name 
	of the file i.e abc
