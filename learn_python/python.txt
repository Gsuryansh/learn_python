If you add these two lines of code to the top of your program:

from random import randint
secret = randint(1, 10)


The secret variable will be set to a random number between 1 and 10. Modify your
program from the facing page so that instead of the answer always being 5, it will
instead use a random number from 1 to 10 as the answer

Swaping two variable without third variable
a=17
b=23
a=(a*b)
b=a/b
a=a/b
print(a,b)


Remainder without using % operator
a=9
b=7

c=a-(a/b)*b
print(c)
