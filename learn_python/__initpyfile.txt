The primary use of __init__.py file is to initialize python package.

Example:- Suppose we have folder structure like this.

          Package/
		      __init__.py
			  file.py
			  file1.py
			  file2.py
			  
			  
			  
			  subpackage/
			          __init__.py
					  submodule1.py
                      submodule2.py
					  

In the above example python interpreter treat package folder as Python package because it contain __init__.py file.


What goes in __init__.py?:- __init__.py can be empty file. But it is often used to perform set need for package.

Suppose we have a class File in file.py and we want to impot it without writing in __init__.py we will do like this.

from Package.file import File

Same can be done like this also by writing in __init__.py file.

Inside __init__.py
     from file import File

from package import File.
