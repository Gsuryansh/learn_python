WAITS:- Today most of the application use ajax. The page is loaded by the browser the elemnt within it may load at different time.
It makes difficult to locate the element if an element is not yet present in the DOM, a locate function will raise an
ElementNotVisibleException exception. Using WAIT u can resolve this issue.

Selenium webdriver provide two type of wait.

1. Explicit Wait:- An explicit wait makes WebDriver wait for a certain condition to occur before proceeding further with execution
2. Implicit Wait:-  An implicit wait makes WebDriver poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to locate an element.
3. Fluent Wait :- An fluent wait makes the driver poll the dom for certain amount of time when trying to locate an element.U can 
also define how frequent driver should check the DOM.U can also ignore NoSuchElementPresent exception.

time.sleep() for explicit wait
driver.implicitly_wait(30)
