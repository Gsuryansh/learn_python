self.driver = webdriver.Firefox()
it will iniciate the firefox instance.

driver.get("Your url")
it will redirect u to your page url. And webdriver wait untill page has fully loaded (that is, the onload event has fired).
But if your code use lot of ajax call then webdriver may not know when the page has fully loaded in that case u need use wait.


Select(driver.find_element_by_id('id')).deselect_all() ## this will deselect all the selected value.

Select(driver.find_element_by_id('id')).all_selected_options ## it will give the list of all the selected option.




        ###############Moving between windows and frames#############
		
		
		driver.switch_to_window("windowname")
		driver.switch_to_frame("frame name")
But how do u know the windows name.

<a href="somewhere.html" target="windowName">Click here to open a new window</a>


Alternatively, you can pass a “window handle” to the “switch_to_window()” method. Knowing this,
it’s possible to iterate over every open window like so:

Ex: for handle in driver.window_handles:
        driver.switch_to_window(handle)	

NOTE:- window_handles return the list contaning name of all the windows present and the first element of the list is current window name.

Ex:- 
    hl=[]
	
	for handle in window_handles:
	    hl.append(handle)
		
	driver.switch_to_frame("frame name")
        	do the operation on this frame
			
	driver.switch_to_frame(hl[0]) # this will switch back to the current frame

or else u can use driver.switch_to_default_content() To return to the current frame.
